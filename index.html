Simply for rent - to spontaneously explore a city, to cycle to the open-air swimming pool with the family on a cargo bike, or to travel to the next gravel race free of bulky luggage. Or as a test-riding service - to check out your dream bike before you buy it. For a few hours, but also for several days and weeks. With the Bike Subscription, we are now expanding your opportunities: subscribe to your dream bike from a wide range, for several months and seasons - as long as you want. We have put our entire network of partner brands and stores, our experience and passion into it. As always: for your Perfect Ride. &q;},&q;details&q;:{&q;1&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;The one out of many&q;,&q;description&q;:&q;Imagine you can choose: transport the kids by cargo bike in autumn, plow through the snow on a gravel bike, start the spring with a road bike...

Generally speaking, the geometry of the frame allows you to sit comfortably, in a more upright position, from which you have a much greater field of view. Most of the time, you’ll be as quick or even faster than if you would have chosen the car or public transportation. The freedom is yours. The pleasure of riding on two wheels means you’ll also see so much more of {{city}}, by always trying new routes and discovering roads you wouldn’t have found when in the car or public transport.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide you can choose from {{n}} city bikes available for rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}. Whether you need a {{subcats}}, we can provide you with everything. &l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Rent your city bike now and make your trip in {{city}} a special one!&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;e-bike&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;Go further, go faster with an E-Bike rental in {{city}}!&q;,&q;description&q;:&q;&l;p&g;E-bikes combine the passion of biking with the drive for technological breakthroughs. With a small battery and motor, an e-bike allows you to travel farther and faster than on a conventional bike.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;There are multiple use-cases for an e-bike: for some, it makes eco-friendly commutes in cities easier, for others, the assistance helps in achieving greater speeds and distances. The electric assistance means that you can cruise in {{city}} on your way to work without breaking a sweat. Or when you’re tired after a long day and need to commute home, or just having a bad day, the electric motor can help you get to your destination in a breeze.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;E-Bikes generally can be ridden as a normal bike too, without any assistance. This means that you can decide with how much effort you exercise, while still being eco-friendlier than driving a car, and safer in the context of social distancing during the Corona crisis, as you can avoid being in close proximity to others in public transportation. Finally, E-Bikes come in all shapes and forms, and at this point, some don’t even look like an e-bike at all!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide, the bike rental platform, you can find {{n}} e-bikes listed for rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}. As mentioned, there are lots of e-bike types out there, and with us you can rent a nice {{subcats}}!

Narrow tyres, aerodynamic geometry, and a lightweight frame are all the combined elements that makes a road bike fast and nimble. Because of this inherent design, the bikes are extremely efficient at covering distances, both short and long. In a short and fast racing context, you will ride at 40-50km/h on average, whereas on long-distance tours over 100km your average speed will drop down to 25-30km/h. Attach some lightweight bikepacking bags, and these machines can carry you across continents!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide we have {{n}} road bikes to rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

Over the years, the mountain bike (MTB) as we know it got perfected over generations, to the point where it’s something truly unique of its own bike type: you will find suspensions on MTBs that absorb the shocks from rocks and roots, large cassettes that allow you to climb the steepest and most rugged trail, and a wide handlebar, to have as much ride control. MTBs will take you where other bikes won’t: you have the ultimate freedom to wander in the wilderness, where no roads are paved, only trails are marked. You can experience the fun world of MTBs at our partner mountain bike parks, as well as renting from our excellent listers, who can always provide you with tips and routes to have a fun time offroad. &l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide you can find {{n}} mountain bikes to rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

They come in the shape of as bicycles or even tricycles, with an enclosed box or a flat platform, in which one can transport groceries, the mail or even your kids! Cargo bikes can be incredibly useful both in big and small cities, making {{city}} the perfect place to rent one. They also cost less than owning a car, and you&s;ll be able to escape the morning traffic jam.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;ListNRide can provide you with {{subcats}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

Follow the ListNRide guide on taking better bike photos, with 13 easy tips!&q;},&q;headline_5&q;:&q;What to shoot?&q;,&q;content_5&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Start with one clear picture, usually from the right-hand side of the bike. This will be the first picture that your Riders will see, so it should give a clear and professional impression of the bike that you have to offer. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;For the remaining 5 photos: highlight what’s amazing. It is not required that the whole bicycle is shown on all photos, rather shoot some details of what you think makes this bike special. Let pictures get the message across. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n&q;,&q;wrong_background&q;:&q;Don’t use a busy background&q;,&q;right_background&q;:&q;Find a neutral background to take great photos of your bike&q;,&q;overview&q;:&q;Your bike listing will look something like this!&q;,&q;list_bike_title&q;:&q;List your first bike now&q;,&q;list_bike_description&q;:&q;Are you confident about the photos you have taken and ready to rent out your bike?

Bike listings with good photos will receive more interest and more rentals.&q;,&q;headline_1&q;:&q;Increase your bike rentals with stellar photography&q;,&q;content_1&q;:&q;Photos are the first thing that a potential Rider sees. Bikes with better photos &l;b&g; reach more riders &l;/b&g; and &l;b&g; receive more bookings &l;/b&g; - so take some time to make them shine! Draw the Riders&s; attention, highlight what’s amazing, and set the right expectations. In this guide we will give you some tips on improving your bike rental photography by using light, setting the scene, using perspectives and knowing what to show! &q;,&q;headline_2&q;:&q;Natural light is your best friend&q;,&q;content_2&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Natural light always looks the best, so take your bike photos outside during the day. Early morning or late afternoon often look the best. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Try to avoid direct sunlight in your photos. This can make the rest of the photo look very dark, or give unwanted light effects that will take attention away from the bike. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;If you do need to shoot the photo indoors, try to use the light from the windows and turn on all lights inside. Using a camera flash is not recommended. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n&q;,&q;headline_3&q;:&q;Set the scene&q;,&q;content_3&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Keep your background as simple as possible, without distractions in frame. A plain wall works well, especially with a light color. Look through your camera screen to check how the photo will look, and clean up any clutter as much as possible before taking the photo. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Place the bike away from the background, at least 1 meter. This will help to create a contrast to your bicycle and make your photos look more professional. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;A clean bike means clean pictures. Try to make your bike look as attractive as you can. Small efforts can make a big difference, like wiping off some mud, placing the pedals in line with the frame, and setting your handlebars straight. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;&q;,&q;headline_4&q;:&q;Perspective&q;,&q;content_4&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Show different angles of the bike, to give your potential Riders a good idea of what they are renting. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Take your photos in landscape format: vertical photos won’t showcase your bicycle as well. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;Always take the main photo from an angle that is parallel to the bike.&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Give space around the edges of the bike. You can use lines in your background to make sure that you are taking a straight photo. &l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Resolution matters: take photos that are at least 1500 x 1000 pixels. When in doubt, a bigger photo is better.&l;/li&g;\n\n&l;/ul&g;&q;,&q;content_title&q;:&q;ListNRide&s;s guide on taking better photos of your bike&q;},&q;how_it_works&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;Bike rental without the hassle&q;,&q;header&q;:&q;ListNRide makes renting a bike simple&q;,&q;subheader&q;:&q;Renting out a bicycle on our platform is as easy as meeting up for coffee:&q;,&q;rider_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;How to rent a bike&q;,&q;step_1_title&q;:&q;Find a bike&q;,&q;step_1_content&q;:&q;Search by type and location&q;,&q;step_2_title&q;:&q;Request &a; Reserve&q;,&q;step_2_content&q;:&q;For a specific time and date&q;,&q;step_3_title&q;:&q;Pick up the bike&q;,&q;step_3_content&q;:&q;Have a chat &a; get insider tips&q;,&q;step_4_title&q;:&q;Off you go&q;,&q;step_4_content&q;:&q;Enjoy your ride!&q;,&q;step_5_title&q;:&q;Return&q;,&q;step_5_content&q;:&q;To owner at agreed time &a; place&q;},&q;lister_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;How to list a bike&q;,&q;step_1_title&q;:&q;List a bike&q;,&q;step_1_content&q;:&q;Add specs, location, photos &a; price&q;,&q;step_2_title&q;:&q;Get Requests&q;,&q;step_2_content&q;:&q;For a specific time and date&q;,&q;step_3_title&q;:&q;Accept Rental&q;,&q;step_3_content&q;:&q;Or suggest a better time &a; date&q;,&q;step_4_title&q;:&q;Meet the Rider&q;,&q;step_4_content&q;:&q;Hand-over bike, chat, give local tips&q;,&q;step_5_title&q;:&q;Get Paid&q;,&q;step_5_content&q;:&q;Payment is credited to your account&q;},&q;handover_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Direct or flexible bike handover: the choice is yours&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;Handing over the bike is rather simple.

This is why we’re working directly with innovative brands to give customers the possibility to test a bike, whether it’s for an hour, a few days, or even a week. Find out more about each brand we work with, and book your test-ride: you’ll now be one step closer to finding out how good your dream bike is!&l;/p&g;&q;,&q;2&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;Test-ride bikes from direct-to-consumer brands&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Direct-to-consumer brands like Canyon, Cowboy, and SUSHI Bikes provide great bikes at competitive prices. However, it’s nearly impossible to see them in real life before buying one, let alone test-ride it. With the ListNRide test-ride program, you can book your own bike testing experience and discover the ins and outs before buying the bike online. &l;/p&g;&q;,&q;3&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;Get a unique, real-life test-ride of your dream e-bike&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;New e-bike brands appear on the market every month, offering excellent value-for-money bicycles.We are the service provider that allows you the real-life test-ride experience of owning an e-bike. You can check how good the bike rides on your commute and if the battery capacity is enough. Test multiple e-bikes and compare the different propelling systems - you will quickly know if you prefer the Bosch, Bafang, or other motor. &l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;4&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;What should I look out for when test-riding a bike?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;We recommend booking for at least a day, so that you can test-ride the dream bike on your usual commute to work and home. The longer the test-ride period, the more familiar you will get with the bike, which will further convince you of its quality. During the handover, you can ask our brand ambassadors any question you might have about the bike.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;5&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;What’s the difference between test-riding with ListNRide and in a traditional bike shop?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Traditionally, it’s very difficult to test-ride a bike and get a real feeling for it when buying at a bike shop. They might allow you to ride it for 5 minutes outside the store, but not much further. The ListNRide test-ride experience is much more relaxed - it’s a familiar, friendly environment where you can try out different bikes and make sure that the bike you’re about to buy really is your dream bike.&l;/p&g;&q;,&q;6&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;How can I stay up to date with new brands joining ListNRide?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on our social media, we regularly update this page with more brands joining our program. &l;/p&g;&q;,&q;7&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;How can I join the ListNRide test-ride program as a brand?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;We’re excited to work with cool new brands, providing customers with a more satisfying purchasing experience!

With our online booking platform, you have access to more than 80.000 bikes across Europe and around the world. We want you to be able to rent the right bike for any terrain — from city cruisers to high-end mountain bikes — anytime, anywhere. And if you have a cool bike that you want to share, you can simply list it on our online platform. We bring bike owners and renters together in a way that benefits both sides. Whether you’re a private or a commercial renter, an ambitious sportsman or a recreational cruiser, we all have one thing in common — the love for bicycles!&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;section_2&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Created on the &l;b&g;Berlin–Munich–Mallorca&l;/b&g; Line&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;Johannes was looking for a racing bike for a spontaneous ride in Mallorca, and a fully equipped mountain bike in Munich to test the Isar trails. Gert-Jan was in Berlin searching for an alternative to cumbersome bike rental shops with limited options. Almost everywhere the two student friends travelled, there was a missing piece to their bicycle happiness, whether it was a tedious search, an awkward frame size or the wrong bicycle type — and that was if they could even find a place to rent a bike to begin with. To spare other bike enthusiasts these common challenges, the two friends, using their combination of digital know-how and passion for biking, developed a solution to find the perfect ride at any time and any place. ListNRide was born.&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;section_3&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Conceived for &l;b&g;city, country, mountains&l;/b&g;&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;Our easy-to-use platform was launched in 2017 to enable members of the public to rent bikes to each other in a secure and trusted way. Since then, we have continued to develop our product and deliver new services to you. Today, you’ll find professional rental companies, bike dealers and trendy bike manufacturers on ListNRide. With insurance coverage included, you can rent bikes for both short trips and multi-day tours, and you can even test your dream bike before buying it. Cruise through Barcelona&s;s Avenidas, do your shopping in Vienna, torture yourself over alpine passes, master the rocky trails at the Lago — with or without e-drive, in S or XL. On our platform, you’ll find top bikes for every terrain, in a size that suits you, far beyond the Berlin-Munich-Mallorca line.&l;/p&g;\n&q;},&q;story_conclusion&q;:&q;We change every place into &l;br&g; &l;b&g;a perfect Ride.&l;/b&g;&q;,&q;section_4&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;The Perfect Ride for you&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;This is by no means the end of the journey: we continue to tinker and optimize every day to get that little bit closer to our vision \&q;WE CHANGE EVERY PLACE INTO A PERFECT RIDE\&q;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Ambitious and relaxed bikers from all areas, design lovers and technology enthusiasts work for us - the main thing is bikes.

If you have a question about the booking process, ask the ListNRide customer service.&q;},&q;4&q;:{&q;question&q;:&q;How do I know if the bike is available?&q;,&q;answer&q;:&q;On the top of the page you will find the booking calendar. Black numbers stand for bookable days, greyed-out dates show that the bike is not available. Some bicycles are offered as test bikes and can be booked for 1 hour slots. &q;},&q;5&q;:{&q;question&q;:&q;How does the payment for the bike rental work?&q;,&q;answer&q;:&q;First, you&s;ll send a booking request, with which the rental amount will be reserved on your account. The moment the request is confirmed, the payment is processed in full. In case your request is not accepted, the reservation is released and the amount will be available on your account shortly. &q;}},&q;become-this-user&q;:&q;Become this user&q;,&q;own_bikes&q;:&q;Rental Bikes&q;,&q;ratings&q;:&q;Ratings&q;,&q;meta-title&q;:&q;{{name}}&s;s profile | ListNRide&q;,&q;meta-description&q;:&q;Rent bikes on ListNRide from {{name}}.&q;,&q;company-meta-title&q;:&q;{{company}}&q;,&q;company-meta-description&q;:&q;Rent bikes on ListNRide from {{company}}.&q;,&q;availability&q;:&q;Availability&q;,&q;not_available&q;:&q;Not available&q;,&q;verified&q;:&q;verified&q;},&q;requests&q;:{&q;booking-overview&q;:&q;Booking Overview&q;,&q;coverage_claim_modal&q;:{&q;problems&q;:{&q;damage&q;:&q;The bike is damaged&q;,&q;theft&q;:&q;The bike was stolen&q;,&q;other&q;:&q;Other&q;},&q;report&q;:&q;Report a problem&q;,&q;damage&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;The bike is damaged&q;,&q;actions&q;:&q;1.

Try to be concise and to the point, whilst also ensuring that all essential information is included. Start with some attention-grabbing sentences describing the bike model and brand. Then mention some details of parts and specs of the bike.\nCheck out &l;a target=\&q;_blank\&q; href=\&q;https://www.listnride.com/products/56678\&q;&g;this listing&l;/a&g; we created as an example for your description and photography. &q;},&q;step3&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;Set the price&q;,&q;body&q;:&q;Setting the rental price of your bikes is completely up to you. To determine an appropriate price, you could compare your bike to similar models or bikes nearby your location already on ListNRide.

You can then enjoy the destination, and later go home by the transport of your choice.&q;},&q;subheader&q;:{&q;1&q;:&q;A one-way bike trip starts from a different location to a desired destination. But a lot of the time, it&s;s not actually the destination that matters the most – it&s;s more about enjoying how you get there, and the amazing journey you&s;ll ride along the way, which makes these bicycle trips so special.&q;,&q;2&q;:&q;Renting a bike for a one-way trip allows you to avoid the hassle of transporting your own bicycle to the start of the trip, and then having to bring it back home again. A lot of trains and planes aren&s;t able to transport bikes, or when they do they may be high additional costs to transport them. Renting a car to drive to your destination with your bike and back is also a pretty expensive option, takes a lot of time, and is not really environmentally friendly. Moreover, there&s;s always a chance your bike might get damaged while being transported, which would be a terrible start to the wonderful bike trip you planned.&q;,&q;3&q;:&q;Pick up the bike at the rental shop at your starting point. Ride it for a weekend, a week or two, or even for a few months. Once your destination has been reached, don&s;t worry about having to ride all the way back to the rental shop where you picked it up – you can just simply leave it at another partner shop.&q;,&q;4&q;:&q;Most of the time, our rental partners provide the right equipment for bikes tours, including packs, helmet and repair kits there might be a small additional fee for the rental company to return the bike to its original location. But renting a bike for an A-to-B cycling trip will always have the same advantages as our normal rentals: the cancellation conditions are identical, and your rental bike is covered by our insurance partner Laka, when rented in the European Economic Area.&q;,&q;5&q;:&q;&l;ol&g;\n&l;li&g;Cross the Alps with the Alpe Adria bicycle path&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Ride along the Atlantic on the french Vélodyssée&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Challenge yourself on stunning mountains roads in the Dolomites&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Discover french culture and castles on the Loire by bike&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Enjoy the beautiful South of France alongside the Canal du Midi&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Ride on the great cycling path of the Weser or the Mosel&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Follow the sacred path to Santiago from Oporto&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Discover the East of Europe from Vienna to Budapest&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Ride up to the great North Cap through Scandinavia&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Ride in the Balkans from Venice to Athens&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ol&g;&q;,&q;6&q;:&q;For the moment, we offer four one-way bicycle routes:\n&l;ol&g;\n&l;li&g; From Hamburg or Berlin to Copenhagen &l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g; The Dalmatian coast from Dubrovnik &l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g; To the end of the Compostela path from Portugal or Spain &l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g; From Vienna to Budapest &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ol&g;\n&l;br/&g; &l;br/&g;\nMost of the routes can be done in both directions, so you can choose where to start and finish.&q;},&q;header&q;:{&q;1&q;:&q;One-way cycling trip&q;,&q;2&q;:&q;Why rent a bike for an A to B bike trip?&q;,&q;3&q;:&q;How does an A to B bike trip with ListNRide work?&q;,&q;4&q;:&q;What is included in a one-way rental bike?&q;,&q;5&q;:&q;Our 10 favorite one-way cycling routes in Europe:&q;,&q;6&q;:&q;Our routes currently available for booking:&q;},&q;choose-your-route&q;:&q;Choose your route!&q;,&q;distance&q;:&q;Total distance: {{distanceValue}} km&q;},&q;wishList&q;:{&q;add&q;:&q;Add to wishlist&q;,&q;added&q;:&q;Added to wishlist&q;,&q;empty&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;There are currently no items in your favorites list!&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;You have no items in your wishlist.

Simply for rent - to spontaneously explore a city, to cycle to the open-air swimming pool with the family on a cargo bike, or to travel to the next gravel race free of bulky luggage. Or as a test-riding service - to check out your dream bike before you buy it. For a few hours, but also for several days and weeks. With the Bike Subscription, we are now expanding your opportunities: subscribe to your dream bike from a wide range, for several months and seasons - as long as you want. We have put our entire network of partner brands and stores, our experience and passion into it. As always: for your Perfect Ride. &q;},&q;details&q;:{&q;1&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;The one out of many&q;,&q;description&q;:&q;Imagine you can choose: transport the kids by cargo bike in autumn, plow through the snow on a gravel bike, start the spring with a road bike...

Generally speaking, the geometry of the frame allows you to sit comfortably, in a more upright position, from which you have a much greater field of view. Most of the time, you’ll be as quick or even faster than if you would have chosen the car or public transportation. The freedom is yours. The pleasure of riding on two wheels means you’ll also see so much more of {{city}}, by always trying new routes and discovering roads you wouldn’t have found when in the car or public transport.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide you can choose from {{n}} city bikes available for rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}. Whether you need a {{subcats}}, we can provide you with everything. &l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Rent your city bike now and make your trip in {{city}} a special one!&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;e-bike&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;Go further, go faster with an E-Bike rental in {{city}}!&q;,&q;description&q;:&q;&l;p&g;E-bikes combine the passion of biking with the drive for technological breakthroughs. With a small battery and motor, an e-bike allows you to travel farther and faster than on a conventional bike.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;There are multiple use-cases for an e-bike: for some, it makes eco-friendly commutes in cities easier, for others, the assistance helps in achieving greater speeds and distances. The electric assistance means that you can cruise in {{city}} on your way to work without breaking a sweat. Or when you’re tired after a long day and need to commute home, or just having a bad day, the electric motor can help you get to your destination in a breeze.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;E-Bikes generally can be ridden as a normal bike too, without any assistance. This means that you can decide with how much effort you exercise, while still being eco-friendlier than driving a car, and safer in the context of social distancing during the Corona crisis, as you can avoid being in close proximity to others in public transportation. Finally, E-Bikes come in all shapes and forms, and at this point, some don’t even look like an e-bike at all!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide, the bike rental platform, you can find {{n}} e-bikes listed for rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}. As mentioned, there are lots of e-bike types out there, and with us you can rent a nice {{subcats}}!

Narrow tyres, aerodynamic geometry, and a lightweight frame are all the combined elements that makes a road bike fast and nimble. Because of this inherent design, the bikes are extremely efficient at covering distances, both short and long. In a short and fast racing context, you will ride at 40-50km/h on average, whereas on long-distance tours over 100km your average speed will drop down to 25-30km/h. Attach some lightweight bikepacking bags, and these machines can carry you across continents!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide we have {{n}} road bikes to rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

Over the years, the mountain bike (MTB) as we know it got perfected over generations, to the point where it’s something truly unique of its own bike type: you will find suspensions on MTBs that absorb the shocks from rocks and roots, large cassettes that allow you to climb the steepest and most rugged trail, and a wide handlebar, to have as much ride control. MTBs will take you where other bikes won’t: you have the ultimate freedom to wander in the wilderness, where no roads are paved, only trails are marked. You can experience the fun world of MTBs at our partner mountain bike parks, as well as renting from our excellent listers, who can always provide you with tips and routes to have a fun time offroad. &l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;On ListNRide you can find {{n}} mountain bikes to rent in {{city}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

They come in the shape of as bicycles or even tricycles, with an enclosed box or a flat platform, in which one can transport groceries, the mail or even your kids! Cargo bikes can be incredibly useful both in big and small cities, making {{city}} the perfect place to rent one. They also cost less than owning a car, and you&s;ll be able to escape the morning traffic jam.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;ListNRide can provide you with {{subcats}}, from exciting brands such as {{brands}}.

Follow the ListNRide guide on taking better bike photos, with 13 easy tips!&q;},&q;headline_5&q;:&q;What to shoot?&q;,&q;content_5&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Start with one clear picture, usually from the right-hand side of the bike. This will be the first picture that your Riders will see, so it should give a clear and professional impression of the bike that you have to offer. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;For the remaining 5 photos: highlight what’s amazing. It is not required that the whole bicycle is shown on all photos, rather shoot some details of what you think makes this bike special. Let pictures get the message across. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n&q;,&q;wrong_background&q;:&q;Don’t use a busy background&q;,&q;right_background&q;:&q;Find a neutral background to take great photos of your bike&q;,&q;overview&q;:&q;Your bike listing will look something like this!&q;,&q;list_bike_title&q;:&q;List your first bike now&q;,&q;list_bike_description&q;:&q;Are you confident about the photos you have taken and ready to rent out your bike?

Bike listings with good photos will receive more interest and more rentals.&q;,&q;headline_1&q;:&q;Increase your bike rentals with stellar photography&q;,&q;content_1&q;:&q;Photos are the first thing that a potential Rider sees. Bikes with better photos &l;b&g; reach more riders &l;/b&g; and &l;b&g; receive more bookings &l;/b&g; - so take some time to make them shine! Draw the Riders&s; attention, highlight what’s amazing, and set the right expectations. In this guide we will give you some tips on improving your bike rental photography by using light, setting the scene, using perspectives and knowing what to show! &q;,&q;headline_2&q;:&q;Natural light is your best friend&q;,&q;content_2&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Natural light always looks the best, so take your bike photos outside during the day. Early morning or late afternoon often look the best. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Try to avoid direct sunlight in your photos. This can make the rest of the photo look very dark, or give unwanted light effects that will take attention away from the bike. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;If you do need to shoot the photo indoors, try to use the light from the windows and turn on all lights inside. Using a camera flash is not recommended. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n&q;,&q;headline_3&q;:&q;Set the scene&q;,&q;content_3&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Keep your background as simple as possible, without distractions in frame. A plain wall works well, especially with a light color. Look through your camera screen to check how the photo will look, and clean up any clutter as much as possible before taking the photo. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Place the bike away from the background, at least 1 meter. This will help to create a contrast to your bicycle and make your photos look more professional. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;A clean bike means clean pictures. Try to make your bike look as attractive as you can. Small efforts can make a big difference, like wiping off some mud, placing the pedals in line with the frame, and setting your handlebars straight. &l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;&q;,&q;headline_4&q;:&q;Perspective&q;,&q;content_4&q;:&q;&l;ul&g;\n &l;li&g;Show different angles of the bike, to give your potential Riders a good idea of what they are renting. &l;/li&g;\n &l;li&g;Take your photos in landscape format: vertical photos won’t showcase your bicycle as well. &l;/li&g;\n  &l;li&g;Always take the main photo from an angle that is parallel to the bike.&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Give space around the edges of the bike. You can use lines in your background to make sure that you are taking a straight photo. &l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;Resolution matters: take photos that are at least 1500 x 1000 pixels. When in doubt, a bigger photo is better.&l;/li&g;\n\n&l;/ul&g;&q;,&q;content_title&q;:&q;ListNRide&s;s guide on taking better photos of your bike&q;},&q;how_it_works&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;Bike rental without the hassle&q;,&q;header&q;:&q;ListNRide makes renting a bike simple&q;,&q;subheader&q;:&q;Renting out a bicycle on our platform is as easy as meeting up for coffee:&q;,&q;rider_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;How to rent a bike&q;,&q;step_1_title&q;:&q;Find a bike&q;,&q;step_1_content&q;:&q;Search by type and location&q;,&q;step_2_title&q;:&q;Request &a; Reserve&q;,&q;step_2_content&q;:&q;For a specific time and date&q;,&q;step_3_title&q;:&q;Pick up the bike&q;,&q;step_3_content&q;:&q;Have a chat &a; get insider tips&q;,&q;step_4_title&q;:&q;Off you go&q;,&q;step_4_content&q;:&q;Enjoy your ride!&q;,&q;step_5_title&q;:&q;Return&q;,&q;step_5_content&q;:&q;To owner at agreed time &a; place&q;},&q;lister_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;How to list a bike&q;,&q;step_1_title&q;:&q;List a bike&q;,&q;step_1_content&q;:&q;Add specs, location, photos &a; price&q;,&q;step_2_title&q;:&q;Get Requests&q;,&q;step_2_content&q;:&q;For a specific time and date&q;,&q;step_3_title&q;:&q;Accept Rental&q;,&q;step_3_content&q;:&q;Or suggest a better time &a; date&q;,&q;step_4_title&q;:&q;Meet the Rider&q;,&q;step_4_content&q;:&q;Hand-over bike, chat, give local tips&q;,&q;step_5_title&q;:&q;Get Paid&q;,&q;step_5_content&q;:&q;Payment is credited to your account&q;},&q;handover_section&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Direct or flexible bike handover: the choice is yours&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;Handing over the bike is rather simple.

This is why we’re working directly with innovative brands to give customers the possibility to test a bike, whether it’s for an hour, a few days, or even a week. Find out more about each brand we work with, and book your test-ride: you’ll now be one step closer to finding out how good your dream bike is!&l;/p&g;&q;,&q;2&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;Test-ride bikes from direct-to-consumer brands&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Direct-to-consumer brands like Canyon, Cowboy, and SUSHI Bikes provide great bikes at competitive prices. However, it’s nearly impossible to see them in real life before buying one, let alone test-ride it. With the ListNRide test-ride program, you can book your own bike testing experience and discover the ins and outs before buying the bike online. &l;/p&g;&q;,&q;3&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;Get a unique, real-life test-ride of your dream e-bike&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;New e-bike brands appear on the market every month, offering excellent value-for-money bicycles.We are the service provider that allows you the real-life test-ride experience of owning an e-bike. You can check how good the bike rides on your commute and if the battery capacity is enough. Test multiple e-bikes and compare the different propelling systems - you will quickly know if you prefer the Bosch, Bafang, or other motor. &l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;4&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;What should I look out for when test-riding a bike?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;We recommend booking for at least a day, so that you can test-ride the dream bike on your usual commute to work and home. The longer the test-ride period, the more familiar you will get with the bike, which will further convince you of its quality. During the handover, you can ask our brand ambassadors any question you might have about the bike.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;5&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;What’s the difference between test-riding with ListNRide and in a traditional bike shop?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Traditionally, it’s very difficult to test-ride a bike and get a real feeling for it when buying at a bike shop. They might allow you to ride it for 5 minutes outside the store, but not much further. The ListNRide test-ride experience is much more relaxed - it’s a familiar, friendly environment where you can try out different bikes and make sure that the bike you’re about to buy really is your dream bike.&l;/p&g;&q;,&q;6&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;How can I stay up to date with new brands joining ListNRide?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;Subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on our social media, we regularly update this page with more brands joining our program. &l;/p&g;&q;,&q;7&q;:&q;&l;h4&g;How can I join the ListNRide test-ride program as a brand?&l;/h4&g;\n&l;p&g;We’re excited to work with cool new brands, providing customers with a more satisfying purchasing experience!

With our online booking platform, you have access to more than 80.000 bikes across Europe and around the world. We want you to be able to rent the right bike for any terrain — from city cruisers to high-end mountain bikes — anytime, anywhere. And if you have a cool bike that you want to share, you can simply list it on our online platform. We bring bike owners and renters together in a way that benefits both sides. Whether you’re a private or a commercial renter, an ambitious sportsman or a recreational cruiser, we all have one thing in common — the love for bicycles!&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;section_2&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Created on the &l;b&g;Berlin–Munich–Mallorca&l;/b&g; Line&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;Johannes was looking for a racing bike for a spontaneous ride in Mallorca, and a fully equipped mountain bike in Munich to test the Isar trails. Gert-Jan was in Berlin searching for an alternative to cumbersome bike rental shops with limited options. Almost everywhere the two student friends travelled, there was a missing piece to their bicycle happiness, whether it was a tedious search, an awkward frame size or the wrong bicycle type — and that was if they could even find a place to rent a bike to begin with. To spare other bike enthusiasts these common challenges, the two friends, using their combination of digital know-how and passion for biking, developed a solution to find the perfect ride at any time and any place. ListNRide was born.&l;/p&g;&q;},&q;section_3&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;Conceived for &l;b&g;city, country, mountains&l;/b&g;&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;Our easy-to-use platform was launched in 2017 to enable members of the public to rent bikes to each other in a secure and trusted way. Since then, we have continued to develop our product and deliver new services to you. Today, you’ll find professional rental companies, bike dealers and trendy bike manufacturers on ListNRide. With insurance coverage included, you can rent bikes for both short trips and multi-day tours, and you can even test your dream bike before buying it. Cruise through Barcelona&s;s Avenidas, do your shopping in Vienna, torture yourself over alpine passes, master the rocky trails at the Lago — with or without e-drive, in S or XL. On our platform, you’ll find top bikes for every terrain, in a size that suits you, far beyond the Berlin-Munich-Mallorca line.&l;/p&g;\n&q;},&q;story_conclusion&q;:&q;We change every place into &l;br&g; &l;b&g;a perfect Ride.&l;/b&g;&q;,&q;section_4&q;:{&q;header&q;:&q;The Perfect Ride for you&q;,&q;content&q;:&q;&l;p&g;This is by no means the end of the journey: we continue to tinker and optimize every day to get that little bit closer to our vision \&q;WE CHANGE EVERY PLACE INTO A PERFECT RIDE\&q;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Ambitious and relaxed bikers from all areas, design lovers and technology enthusiasts work for us - the main thing is bikes.

If you have a question about the booking process, ask the ListNRide customer service.&q;},&q;4&q;:{&q;question&q;:&q;How do I know if the bike is available?&q;,&q;answer&q;:&q;On the top of the page you will find the booking calendar. Black numbers stand for bookable days, greyed-out dates show that the bike is not available. Some bicycles are offered as test bikes and can be booked for 1 hour slots. &q;},&q;5&q;:{&q;question&q;:&q;How does the payment for the bike rental work?&q;,&q;answer&q;:&q;First, you&s;ll send a booking request, with which the rental amount will be reserved on your account. The moment the request is confirmed, the payment is processed in full. In case your request is not accepted, the reservation is released and the amount will be available on your account shortly. &q;}},&q;become-this-user&q;:&q;Become this user&q;,&q;own_bikes&q;:&q;Rental Bikes&q;,&q;ratings&q;:&q;Ratings&q;,&q;meta-title&q;:&q;{{name}}&s;s profile | ListNRide&q;,&q;meta-description&q;:&q;Rent bikes on ListNRide from {{name}}.&q;,&q;company-meta-title&q;:&q;{{company}}&q;,&q;company-meta-description&q;:&q;Rent bikes on ListNRide from {{company}}.&q;,&q;availability&q;:&q;Availability&q;,&q;not_available&q;:&q;Not available&q;,&q;verified&q;:&q;verified&q;},&q;requests&q;:{&q;booking-overview&q;:&q;Booking Overview&q;,&q;coverage_claim_modal&q;:{&q;problems&q;:{&q;damage&q;:&q;The bike is damaged&q;,&q;theft&q;:&q;The bike was stolen&q;,&q;other&q;:&q;Other&q;},&q;report&q;:&q;Report a problem&q;,&q;damage&q;:{&q;title&q;:&q;The bike is damaged&q;,&q;actions&q;:&q;1.

But a lot of the time, it&s;s not actually the destination that matters the most – it&s;s more about enjoying how you get there, and the amazing journey you&s;ll ride along the way, which makes these bicycle trips so special.&q;,&q;2&q;:&q;Renting a bike for a one-way trip allows you to avoid the hassle of transporting your own bicycle to the start of the trip, and then having to bring it back home again. A lot of trains and planes aren&s;t able to transport bikes, or when they do they may be high additional costs to transport them. Renting a car to drive to your destination with your bike and back is also a pretty expensive option, takes a lot of time, and is not really environmentally friendly. Moreover, there&s;s always a chance your bike might get damaged while being transported, which would be a terrible start to the wonderful bike trip you planned.&q;,&q;3&q;:&q;Pick up the bike at the rental shop at your starting point. Ride it for a weekend, a week or two, or even for a few months. Once your destination has been reached, don&s;t worry about having to ride all the way back to the rental shop where you picked it up – you can just simply leave it at another partner shop.&q;,&q;4&q;:&q;Most of the time, our rental partners provide the right equipment for bikes tours, including packs, helmet and repair kits there might be a small additional fee for the rental company to return the bike to its original location.
